# PantryPal ðŸ¥•
PantryPal is a web app that aims to help users manage their pantry more effectively and reduce food waste by tracking pantry items and recommending recipes using ingredients that will soon expire. This app will simplify the process of finding recipes and ensure that users maximize their ingredient usage before they go bad.
